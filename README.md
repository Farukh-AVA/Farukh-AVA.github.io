<h1>K&G van Express</h1>
<br>
 This website can advertise transportation services, get quotes, 
 sell products in online stores, and gets resumes for new drivers. The web application is able to get quotes from users and 
 set available times for pick up and drop off with a friendly interface that connects clients with dispatch. The online store 
 allows drivers to buy products related to the transport industry such as GPS 
 navigators, headphones, etc. by using credit/debit cards. I Developed the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, 
 however, the back end of this project is still ongoing.
